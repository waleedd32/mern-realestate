## Overview

This repository contains two main folders:

1. client: Front-end React application using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Redux for state management.
2. server: Back-end Express server with Mongoose for MongoDB integration, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

The application allows users to sign up, log in, create or view real estate listings, and search for properties based on various criteria (e.g., location, price).

## Features

- User Authentication: Secure sign-up, log-in, and log-out using JWT.
- Property Listings: Add, edit, and delete property listings with images and details.
- Search and Filter: Quickly find properties based on location, price, or property type.
- Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS makes it simple to create a fully responsive layout.
- Redux State Management: Centralized, predictable state management in the front end.
