## Overview

This repository contains two main folders:

1. client: Front-end React application using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Redux for state management.
2. server: Back-end Express server with Mongoose for MongoDB integration, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

The application allows users to sign up, log in, create or view real estate listings, and search for properties based on various criteria (e.g., location, price).
